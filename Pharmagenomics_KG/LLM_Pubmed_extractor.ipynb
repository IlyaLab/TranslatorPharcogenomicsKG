      "METHODS: The inhibitory effects of SSA on the proliferation of AML cell lines \n",
      "K562 and HL60 were evaluated using CCK8 and EdU assays. Apoptotic effects \n",
      "induced by SSA were analyzed via flow cytometry. RNA sequencing was performed to \n",
      "identify differentially expressed genes and enriched signaling pathways. Western \n",
      "blot analysis was utilized to confirm the involvement of ERS and activation of \n",

      "analysis demonstrated that SSA induces apoptosis in AML cells through the \n",
      "mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Transcriptomic profiling and Western blot \n",
      "analyses confirmed that SSA activates the ERS-mediated p-JNK signaling pathway \n",
      "to induce apoptosis in AML, a process that can be reversed by the addition of \n",
      "4PBA or SP600125. Furthermore, SSA significantly reduced tumor volume and weight \n",
